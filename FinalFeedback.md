    The presentation is very creative, and I really enjoyed watching it. The audio is a little bit unclear, but still understandable. The presentation was almost perfect except that you forgot to include the individual concluding thoughts.

    The report was very well written. It is very thorough and informative. I liked how you included both runtime and result analysis along with some nice graphical outputs.

    The README is very easy to follow, and the step by step command lines are very user-friendly. The example ouputs are also a plus. It seems you used the cs225 docker as the development environemnt. It will be nice if you include environment configuration in README as well.
