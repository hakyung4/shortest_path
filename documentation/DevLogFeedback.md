Promissing progress! The dev log is thorough and neat. Keep up with the good work.

### Week April 4 ~ April 10

PASS

Very thorough dev log. I understand that these weeks could be busy due to the midterm, but your current progress is slightly lagging behind. Try to use this and next week to prepare for the mid checkin, and let us know if there is any trouble regarding your final project.
