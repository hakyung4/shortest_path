Promissing progress! The dev log is thorough and neat. Keep up with the good work.

### Week April 4 ~ April 10

PASS

Very thorough dev log. I understand that these weeks could be busy due to the midterm, but your current progress is slightly lagging behind. Try to use this and next week to prepare for the mid checkin, and let us know if there is any trouble regarding your final project.

### Week April 11 ~ April 17

PASS

Glad to see that you guys catched up on the progress. To test for for parsing and BFS, you can manually make a small graph with just few nodes and egdes, and try to parse and run BFS on it see whether it is able to produce outputs as you expect. Note that the tests will be checked at the mid-checkin, so be sure to have it ready by your mid-checkin date. Let me know if you have any questions.
