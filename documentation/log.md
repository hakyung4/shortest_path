# Development Log

## Week 1 (03/27 - 04/02):
### To do:
- Create basic file structure

- Create github branches and structure

- Add/process dataset and configure file type

- Implement data storage
- Implement initial visualisation of our dataset (print function)

- Update proposal
    - New dataset: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/SpatialDataset.htm
    - Assign dataset weights (done: assign them to the distance between nodes)
    - Outputs: 
        a) the time it took for each algorithm to arrive at the shortest path
        b) a force directed graph representing the navigation route
    - Platform used for force directed graph: python
    - Meeting times:
      - Friday: 5-7pm
      - Saturday: 2-4pm

## Week 2 (04/03 - 04/09)
### What we accomplished

- We created basic file structure.

- We created github branches and structure.

- We added/processed dataset and configure file type.

- We updated proposal.

### Contribution

1. Ahmed(anahas2):
    - Updated proposal.
    - Added/processed dataset and configure file type.

2. Peter (hakyung4): 
    - Created github branches and structure.
    - Created basic file structure.
    - Added/processed dataset and configure file type.

3. Kevin (sangwoo2):
    - Updated proposal.
    - Added/processed dataset and configure file type.

4. Akhil (analla6):
    - Updated proposal.
    - Added/processed dataset and configure file type.

### Obstacles
We had a delay in our progress because we had to update our proposal with given feedback from our mentor. Since everyone was busy on weekdays, we met up on April 2nd, Saturday, to discuss more about our project. However, updating proposal and solving issues that we previously had were not too hard to solve with an excellent dataset. Overall, updating our proposal delayed our progress, but we were still able to make some progress.

### Plan for this week
- Begin working on storing dataset either into adjacency matrix or list

- Begin working on BFS implementation to the project

- Completion of importing data into Visual Studio 

- Complete working on creating file structure

## Week 3 (04/10 - 04/16)
### What we accomplished

- We could not accomplish anything because of quizzes and tests everyone had this week. 

### Contribution

1. Ahmed(anahas2):

2. Peter (hakyung4): 

3. Kevin (sangwoo2):

4. Akhil (analla6):

### Obstacles
We were planning on meeting up on our regular meeting times, but we could not make either of them because everyone had quizzes and tests this week, which made impossible to find the time that worked for everyone. Also, some team members had interviews for their internships, and everyone agreed that preparing interview is more important as of now because we can make more progress on the following week.

### Plan for this week
- Finish on storing dataset either into adjacency matrix or list

- Finish on BFS implementation to the project

- Finish working on creating file structure

## Week 4 (04/17 - 04/23)
### What we accomplished

- We successfully stored our dataset in adjacency list.

- We implemented BFS.

### Contribution

1. Ahmed(anahas2): 
    - Implemented BFS.
    - Implemented Data storage.

2. Peter (hakyung4):
    - Implemented BFS.
    - Implemented Data storage.

3. Kevin (sangwoo2):
    - Implemented BFS.
    - Implemented Data storage.

4. Akhil (analla6): 
    - Implemented BFS.
    - Implemented Data storage.

### Obstacles
Although we were able to succesfully store the dataset and implemented BFS, we are not sure if they are correct or not. We could not come up with ways to verify our implementations.

### Plan for this week
- Verify our implementations for BFS and data storage.

- Move implementations to separate file such as Graph.h and Graph.cpp, and construct a class.

- Implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

## Week 5 (04/24 - 04/30)
### What we accomplished

✓ Create smaller graph for testing, add data correction step (start small, test, build up)
✓ Finalize BFS to consider all routes, store and decide on smallest path (80%) [Kevin, Ahmed]
✓ Create a class
✓ Clean directory (create better structure)
- Python Map
- Test cases [Kevin, Ahmed]
- Djikastra's algorithm [Akhil, Peter]
