# Development Log

## Week 1:
### To do:
✓ Create basic file structure
✓ Create github branches and structure
✓ Add/process dataset and configure file type
✓ Implement data storage
- BFS
- Implement initial visualisation of our dataset (print function)
✓ Update proposal
    - New dataset: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/SpatialDataset.htm
    - Assign dataset weights (done: assign them to the distance between nodes)
    - Outputs: 
        a) the time it took for each algorithm to arrive at the shortest path
        b) a force directed graph representing the navigation route
    - Platform used for force directed graph: python
    - Meeting times:
      - Friday:   5-7pm
      - Saturday: 2-4pm



## Week 3:
### To do:
✓ Create smaller graph for testing, add data correction step (start small, test, build up)
- Finalize BFS to consider multiple routes, store and decide on smallest path (80%) [Kevin, Ahmed]
- BFS w/ weights?
- Map
- Create a class
- Clean directory (create better structure)
- Test cases [Kevin, Ahmed]
- Djikastra's algorithm [Akhil, Peter]
