# Development Log

## Week 1 (03/27 - 04/02):
### To do:
- Create basic file structure

- Create github branches and structure

- Add/process dataset and configure file type

- Implement data storage
- Implement initial visualisation of our dataset (print function)

- Update proposal
    - New dataset: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/SpatialDataset.htm
    - Assign dataset weights (done: assign them to the distance between nodes)
    - Outputs: 
        a) the time it took for each algorithm to arrive at the shortest path
        b) a force directed graph representing the navigation route
    - Platform used for force directed graph: python
    - Meeting times:
      - Friday:   5-7pm
      - Saturday: 2-4pm

## Week 2 (04/03 - 04/09)
### What we accomplished

- We created basic file structure.

- We created github branches and structure.

- We added/processed dataset and configure file type.

- We updated proposal.

### Contribution

1. Ahmed(anahas2):
    - Updated proposal.
    - Added/processed dataset and configure file type.

2. Peter (hakyung4): 
    - Created github branches and structure.
    - Created basic file structure.
    - Added/processed dataset and configure file type.

3. Kevin (sangwoo2):
    - Updated proposal.
    - Added/processed dataset and configure file type.

4. Akhil (analla6):
    - Updated proposal.
    - Added/processed dataset and configure file type.

### Obstacles
We had a delay in our progress because we had to update our proposal with given feedback from our mentor. Since everyone was busy on weekdays, we met up on April 2nd, Saturday, to discuss more about our project. However, updating proposal and solving issues that we previously had were not too hard to solve with an excellent dataset. Overall, updating our proposal delayed our progress, but we were still able to make some progress.

### Plan for this week
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Convert .txt file to .csv file to access it with a better runtime

- Discuss which data structure we are going to use and implement data storage

- Construct a graph

- Initial visualization of data
=======
- Begin working on storing dataset either into adjacency matrix or list
- Begin working on BFS implementation to the project
- Completion of importing data into Visual Studio 
- Complete working on creating file structure
>>>>>>> origin
