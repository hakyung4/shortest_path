# Development Log

## Week 1 (03/27 - 04/02):
### To do:
- Create basic file structure

- Create github branches and structure

- Add/process dataset and configure file type

- Implement data storage
- Implement initial visualisation of our dataset (print function)

- Update proposal
    - New dataset: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/SpatialDataset.htm
    - Assign dataset weights (done: assign them to the distance between nodes)
    - Outputs: 
        a) the time it took for each algorithm to arrive at the shortest path
